# Hi There 👋, and Welcome to My GitHub!

My name is Tudor and I am a 1st year CS 💻 student from the University of Western Ontario 🟪⬜, also pursuing business. My primary interests right now are in learning fullstack development and API testing.


⚡ **Fun facts about me**

I like to play basketball, boulder, bake on my off time, watch anime and read manga, and take hikes in nature.


🛠 **Languages and Skills**

I've primarily worked with Java & Python in my school work. On top this, I'm working with JavaScript, Python, Flask, React/React Native, and Express/Node in my current projects. I've also dabbled a bit in Postgres.


🔭 **Some Projects I'm Working On**

Syllabi 📆 - A web app tool that allows students to upload their course outlines and instantly export their course schedule to Google Calendar.

Umami 🍲 - Collaborating with my 4 fellow directors @ WFN to create a recipe app, allowing users to upload pictures of ingredients to generate recipes, and post their creations on a global dashboard and interact with their friends!
